As Active Safety Map & Cloud System Developer, you will be part of a team working with map data needs for a fused environmental perception, as well as a solution for probe sourcing sensor data for keeping a cloud based map continuously up to date and reliable enough to be used for autonomous driving.
Main responsibilities

One of your responsibilities will be to design the system solution as well as writing and releasing requirements and documentation, supporting the development in these areas. In this work, you need to have a close collaboration with the Function Owners within Active Safety as well as other stakeholders within Volvo Cars globally, such as the Infotainment/Navigation area, the team within Volvo Cars IT working with the cloud development and the Sensor Performance team.

-Further, as a Senior Developer, you will collaborate closely with our map suppliers, as well as our SW Partner Zenuity, in all phases of the Active Safety and Autonomous Drive projects. You will also work to define strategies and new technology steps / advanced engineering within the area together with the Map & Cloud Team Leader.


Basic:
What is sensor fusion?
- Many sensors are equipped in a car. Integrate different cameras, radars can help to achieve a acurate status of a car in the environment.

- However, every sensor has its pros and cons. e.g. take two sensors in a cellphone, accerometer is not accurate while error will not be accumulated. gyro is accurate in returning the changes, while errors will be accumulated.
- Kalman filter is a classic tool to do sensor fusion.

Why a high definition map is needed?

What is the relationship between sensor fusion and HAD?
What have you done for sensor fusion and HAD?

What are sensors in a car?
- CMOS cameras will be blinded in a rainy and floggy whether
- Radars perform well in bad weather condition while their resolution is not that good.
- LiDAR ToF Technology using light. based on different reflection of signal it determines the surface. e.g. diffuse reflection, retro-reflection

One example for sensor fusion in a car?
- Back camera and ultrasonic range finder for parking
- Front camera and multi module radars for ADAS

Sensor fusion systems
- centralized
- distributed

Practical experience about Sensor Fusion, Map and Cloud:
- Apollo Cloud platform
    - HD Map: openDRIVE
    - OTA
    - Data Platform

Companies:
- Civil Maps
    - base map
    - camera view, voxel view
    - get feature points based on the base map(SLAM)
    - second car can reuse the based map and localizes itself
    - 80% - +/-5cm
